# Brain tumor detection through MRI image recognition

## Abstract

This research investigates the predictive ability of various machine learning al-1
gorithms on identifying brain tumors based on data extracted from brain MRIs.
This research aims to demonstrate the optimal algorithm for brain tumor detection3
and present the most important features that could indicate the existence of this4
disease.
